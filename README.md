## 1. Install

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**
```sh
curl -fsSL cem.pw/install | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell — not CMD, not Git Bash):**
```powershell
irm cem.pw/install | iex
```

That's it. You now have three commands on your PATH: `cem`, `cemi`, `cemir`.

---

## 2. First run

```sh
cem "what is fibonacci?"
```

A short wizard opens the first time. Pick one AI to **think** and one to **write**. Pick a model for each (or hit Enter for the AI's default). Done.

If a tool isn't installed yet, cem offers to install it for you. If Node.js or another prerequisite is missing, cem offers to install that too — via `winget` (Windows), `brew` (macOS), or `nvm` (Linux).

---

## 3. Three commands you'll actually use

```sh
cem "explain this codebase"         # ask the THINKER (one AI)
cem -w "write a quicksort in Go"    # ask the WRITER (one AI)
cem -p "build me a CLI tool"        # PAIR: thinker plans, writer codes
```

That's the whole product. The pair mode is the interesting one — the thinker analyses the task and hands its plan to the writer, so the code you get is informed by reasoning from a different model.

---

## 4. Login

After installing an AI tool, cem asks how you want to authenticate:

```
  Claude için auth:
    [1] API key kaydet  (multiple keys + auto-rotation on rate limit)
    [2] Subscription / OAuth login  (run 'claude' to start the browser flow)
    [3] Skip
```

Pick **1** if you have an API key (Anthropic Console / OpenAI Platform). Pick **2** if you have a subscription (Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, Antigravity, Cursor).

Add or check keys any time:
```sh
cem keys add anthropic     # paste your sk-ant-... key
cem keys list              # masked view
cem keys remove openai 2   # delete the 2nd OpenAI key
```

Multiple keys are tried in order; when one hits a rate limit cem rotates to the next automatically. That's how a 3-hour project doesn't get interrupted.

---

## 5. Update / Uninstall

```sh
cem update         # fetch the latest release
cem uninstall      # remove cem
cemir all          # remove the installed AI tools
```

cem checks for new versions in the background and shows a one-line notice if there's an update — never blocks you.

## Want more?

That covers maybe 80% of daily use. For everything else — project-specific configs, OAuth code helpers, custom models, deeper pair-mode rules, build-from-source — see [ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md).
